# 🏠 House Price Prediction App

This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the price of a house based on certain key features. The app uses a **machine learning model (XGBoost)** trained on housing data to provide accurate predictions.  

---

## Features

The app takes the following inputs from the user:

- **OverallQual**: Overall quality of the house (1-10 scale).  
- **GrLivArea**: Above ground living area (in square feet).  
- **FullBath**: Number of full bathrooms in the house.  
- **YearBuilt**: Year the house was built.  
- **GarageYrBlt**: Year the garage was built.  
- **CentralAir**: Whether the house has central air conditioning (Yes/No).  

Based on these features, the app predicts the **house price**.
